# A-to-Z-Hand-Gesture-Recognizer

1. Project Title & Objective
Project Title:

Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition Using MediaPipe and Random Forest Classifier

Objective:

The objective of this project is to build a real-time hand gesture recognition system that detects hand landmarks using MediaPipe, processes them into normalized features, and predicts gestures (A–Z) using a Random Forest machine learning model.
The system also provides audio feedback by playing the predicted letter sound.

2. Dataset Details
Dataset Creation

Dataset is manually created using createdataset.py.

Gestures: A–Z (26 classes)

Images per class: 100 images

Total dataset size: 2600 images

Images captured using webcam in real time.

Dataset Processing

Using collectimage.py:

Each image is processed with MediaPipe Hands.

Extracts 21 hand landmarks → each with (x, y).

Coordinates normalized:
normalized_value = landmark_coordinate - min(all_coordinates)

Final feature vector per image: 42 values.

Stored in data.pickle as:

data: list of features

labels: corresponding gesture labels

3. Algorithm / Model Used
Hand Landmark Extraction – MediaPipe

Detects 21 stable hand landmarks.

Works in both static and real-time mode.

Provides consistent x–y coordinates.

Machine Learning Model – Random Forest

Trained using trainmodel.py:

n_estimators = 300

max_depth = 25

Uses 80-20 Train–Test Split.

Input features: 42 normalized landmark coordinates.

Output: Gesture label (A–Z).

Why Random Forest?

Handles non-linear patterns in landmark data.

Robust to noise.

Works well with medium-sized datasets.

No feature scaling required.

5. Conclusion

This project successfully implements a fully functional real-time alphabet gesture recognition system using a combination of:

MediaPipe for robust landmark detection

Random Forest for gesture classification

Flask for web-based deployment

Audio output using playsound for accessibility

The system performs well on custom-created images and achieves high testing accuracy, demonstrating reliability for controlled lighting and background conditions.

6. Future Scope

Add support for numbers (0–9) and dynamic gestures.

Use Deep Learning models (CNN, LSTM, GestureNet) for higher accuracy.

Deploy as a mobile or desktop app.

Improve dataset with more variations:

Different lighting

Background clutter

Multiple users

Add text-to-speech continuous word formation.

Add gesture smoothing to filter out noisy predictions.

Integrate sign language word-level recognition.
